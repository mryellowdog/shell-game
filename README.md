# shell game
This is a game written in Python. Instead of using a module like pygame or turtle, I chose to hand-code the entire game without help from any modules.
The game plays in the shell using a (very) primitive graphics system.

# How to play
1. Start the game.py file in Python
2. Resize the window so that it only includes the game screen.
3. You control the (#) character. The goal of the game is to get to the (o) character, without hitting the (%) character.
4. Use WASD to move. You will have to click Enter each time you move. For example
   W, Enter
   D, Enter
   S, Enter
